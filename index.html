            <p>I have been a realtor for a little over 10 years and sales have become a real passion for me. I got married 10 years ago and my wife and I have 3 sons and are expecting a daughter for next summer.
                I decided to enroll in BYU pathway because of a prompting my wife and I had last year that I should finish a professional education.
                I decided to enroll in software development because I find that I have the ability to understand technology (even if I have not delved into it too much), because I think it is a good career for the future and it can help me further develop my business.
                I have my own small realty business, my wife has a bachelor degree in international business and used to work in the meetings industry for a hotel company  but quit shortly after our 3rd son was born and now helps me in our business, in a few years we have been able to make it grow.
                We have been living in Puerto Morelos, México since 2018 and we really enjoy the natural setting and beautiful beaches in the area one of our favorite family activities is watching the sun rise from the beach and spend a morning there.
                I am currently serving a bishop in our ward and my wife teaches a Sunday school class in english for foreigners that come to our ward. I served in the Tijuana, Mexico mission and one of our goals as a couple is to go to a mission together once our kids are older. I´m 34.</p>

            <p> Living in Puerto Morelos means enjoying peace, security, and the natural beauty of the Riviera Maya without the hustle and bustle of big cities. The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System is here and it’s a diver’s and snorkelers paradise. Plus, its rich gastronomy, vibrant culture, and friendly community make every day a unique experience.</p>
